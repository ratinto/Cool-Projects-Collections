# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – Intuition, Algorithm, Complexity  
Welcome to the **Data Structures & Algorithms Questions Repository** by Ritesh ([@ratinto](https://github.com/ratinto)).  
This space is dedicated to building a **community-driven library** of DS/A problems, explained in depth — not just solved — with emphasis on *intuition*, *algorithmic approach*, and *complexity analysis*.

## 🚀 Our Mission  
> “Help developers *understand*, *think through*, and *explain* data-structures problems — not just code them.”  
Whether you’re preparing for coding interviews, deepening your algorithmic thinking, or just contributing to open-source, this repository is for you.
