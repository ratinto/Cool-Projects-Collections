# ðŸŽ¯ Features Overview

Here's what the app does. I tried to keep it focused on the core problem - making resumes better for specific jobs.

## Core Features

### Resume Upload
Pretty straightforward:
- Upload PDF, DOCX, or DOC files
- Supports multiple pages (yeah, some people have 2-page resumes)
- Preview your resume before optimizing
- Parse text without breaking formatting

I spent way too much time getting PDF parsing to work properly. PyPDF2 was annoying.

### Job Description Input
Simple interface for pasting job descriptions:
- Paste directly from job boards
- Or upload a PDF job description
- Extract key requirements automatically
- Identify must-have vs nice-to-have skills

The AI figures out what keywords matter most.

### AI Matching & Rewriting
This is where the magic happens:
- Analyzes your resume against the job description
- Identifies relevant skills and experiences
- Rewrites bullet points to match job requirements
- Suggests better action verbs
- Maintains your resume structure

**Watch out:** Sometimes the AI gets a bit too creative. Always review the suggestions!

### ATS Optimization
This was tricky to implement:
- Suggests keyword placement
- Checks for ATS-friendly formatting
- Identifies missing important terms
- Estimates ATS compatibility score
- Points out common ATS-killing mistakes

The ATS scoring is approximate - different systems vary, but I tried to match common patterns.

### Export Options
Export your optimized resume:
- PDF export (most common format)
- DOCX export (for further editing)
- Maintains formatting
- Professional appearance

PDF generation can be finicky with complex layouts.

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Resume Templates
I included a few templates:
- Tech/Software Engineer format
- Business/Professional format
- Academic/CV format
- Custom template upload

Starting with just a few templates - might add more later.

### Keyword Analysis Dashboard
Visual breakdown of matching:
- Keywords found in both resume and job description
- Missing keywords from job description
- Unique skills in your resume
- Keyword density visualization

Helps you understand what's working and what's not.

### Skill Gap Identification
Identifies what you're missing:
- Skills required but not in your resume
- Skills you have but job doesn't mention
- Suggests how to bridge gaps

Useful for figuring out what to learn next.

### Resume Version History
Keep track of changes:
- Save multiple versions
- Compare versions side-by-side
- Revert to previous versions
- Track which jobs each version was for

I added this because I kept overwriting good versions accidentally.

### Comparison View
See before/after side-by-side:
- Highlight changes made by AI
- Show ATS score improvement
- Visual diff of modifications
- Export comparison report

Really helps see the actual improvements.

## Future Enhancements

### LinkedIn Integration
Would be really cool:
- Scrape job descriptions from LinkedIn
- Auto-apply with optimized resume
- Track application status
- Import LinkedIn profile data

This would save so much time if I could get it working reliably.

### Cover Letter Generator
Generate matching cover letters:
- AI writes cover letter based on resume and job
- Matches tone to job description
- Highlights relevant experience
- Multiple versions to choose from

Probably coming in version 2.

### Interview Prep
Help prepare for interviews:
- Generate potential questions based on job
- Practice answers for common questions
- Tips based on your resume content
- Industry-specific advice

Could be really helpful for actual job seekers.

### Analytics Dashboard
Track your job search:
- Which resumes got callbacks
- Average time to hear back
- Success rate by industry
- Common keywords that work

Data-driven job hunting!

### Multi-language Support
Support for international resumes:
- Translate to different languages
- Job descriptions in other languages
- Resume templates for different countries
- Cultural adaptation suggestions

Would make this way more useful globally.

### PDF Generation Quality
Better PDF output:
- WYSIWYG editor for resume
- More template customization
- Better formatting control
- Preview while editing

The current PDF generation is okay but could be better.

That's what I've got planned! Let me know if you have other ideas for features.
