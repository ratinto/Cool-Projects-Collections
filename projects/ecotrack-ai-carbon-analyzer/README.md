# 🌱 EcoTrack – AI Carbon Footprint Analyzer

Okay so I've been trying to be more eco-friendly but honestly had no clue how much CO₂ I was actually producing daily. Like, is my morning commute worse than ordering takeout three times a week? No idea. So I came up with this project idea - basically a sustainability tracker that uses AI to calculate your carbon footprint from stuff like travel, electricity, and shopping. Then it gives you actual tips you can use to cut down emissions. The cool part is you can manually log your day or hook it up to Google Fit to track automatically.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Features
- ✅ **Activity Input**: Enter daily activities (commute, meals, energy use) manually
- ✅ **API Integration**: Connect Google Fit or similar APIs for automatic activity tracking
- ✅ **AI Carbon Calculation**: Uses reliable emission datasets to calculate CO₂ footprint
- ✅ **Personal Dashboard**: Visual charts and weekly emission reports
- ✅ **AI Recommendations**: Get personalized suggestions for reducing your carbon footprint
- ✅ **Activity History**: Track your emissions over time

### Advanced Features
- ✅ Gamified system with levels and badges
- ✅ Community leaderboards for friendly competition
- ✅ Weather and location-based contextual insights
- ✅ CO₂ offset partnership integration
- ✅ Social sharing of achievements

## 🎯 Why It's Cool

Look, everyone talks about being sustainable, but where do you even start? That's why I think this is a cool idea. Instead of vague "be better" advice, you get actual numbers showing your impact. Plus:
- You can finally see what's actually hurting vs helping
- AI suggests changes that make sense for YOUR lifestyle (not generic BS)
- Added some gamification because let's be honest, badges and levels make everything more fun
- Leaderboards mean you can compete with friends (or just flex your eco-score)
- It's not preachy - just shows you the data and lets you decide

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need:
- Node.js 18+ (for Next.js)
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- OpenAI API Key
- Google Fit API credentials (optional)
- Git

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecotrack-ai-carbon-analyzer.git
cd ecotrack-ai-carbon-analyzer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY
# - DATABASE_URL
# - GOOGLE_FIT_CLIENT_ID (optional)
# - NEXTAUTH_SECRET

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Make sure your OpenAI API key is set up correctly or the AI recommendations won't work.

## 🎨 Difficulty Level

**Advanced** - Not gonna lie, this one's pretty challenging.

You'll be dealing with:
- AI prompt engineering (getting the AI to give useful tips vs generic garbage takes iteration)
- Multiple API integrations (Google Fit, weather data, etc.)
- Carbon emission math (there's legit datasets for this but you need to figure out the formulas)
- Charts and data viz (making it look good AND be accurate)
- Gamification logic (points, levels, badges - the works)
- Handling real-time activity data

Honestly? The trickiest part is the carbon calculations. You need reliable emission data and you have to make sure your math is solid. Second hardest is getting the AI to give contextual advice that's actually helpful - like "bike instead of driving" when it's raining is pretty useless.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

There's SO much you could add to make this even better:
- 📱 **Mobile App**: Would be way more useful as a native app with push notifications
- 🌍 **Global Impact**: Show the entire community's combined impact (imagine if 10k people saved X tons of CO₂)
- 🛒 **Product Scanner**: Scan barcodes at the store to see a product's carbon footprint before buying
- 🚗 **Smart Home Integration**: Hook it up to your smart meter, thermostat, etc. for automatic tracking
- 📊 **Corporate Version**: Companies could track their team's progress
- 💰 **Carbon Credits**: Let people actually buy carbon offsets right in the app
- 🤝 **Weekly Challenges**: Like "no car week" or "vegetarian week" with rewards
- 📈 **Predictive Analytics**: AI could predict next month's footprint based on your patterns and warn you

If you've got other ideas, I'd love to hear them!

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

If you actually build this, you'll learn a ton:
- How to work with AI APIs and craft prompts that give useful results
- Carbon emission formulas and where to find good datasets
- Making data look good with Chart.js or Recharts
- Gamification design (it's harder than it looks to make it feel rewarding)
- Connecting to external APIs like Google Fit
- How environmental tracking actually works
- Processing real-time user data without things getting slow

**Pro tip:** Start with the carbon math first. Get that working with reliable datasets, then build the UI around it. Trust me, if your calculations are off, the whole app falls apart.
